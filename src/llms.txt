### Sectors

1. **AI Mechanicals** — Physical machinery that forms the mechanical layer for producing abundant intelligence. Chips, fabs, reactors, turbines, cooling systems, transformers. Constrained by principles of physics.
2. **Scarce Crypto** — Assets that resiliently store value and move at high velocity with minimal friction. Fewer middlemen, more ownership. Scarce crypto assets only.
3. **Defense Tech** — Security is a timeless imperative. AI and robotics create new conflict vectors requiring innovation. Autonomous hardware and systems, cyber defense, space.
4. **Health Tech** — AI unlocks what was previously thought impossible in human biology. Human upgrades for an age of exponential change. The gift of life.
5. **Community Experience** — Real-world human experiences that are already scarce and will only become more so in the world of AI. Connection, presence, shared moments, human excellence.
6. **Fund of Funds** — Strategic LP positions in aligned venture funds.

## What We Believe

- The current AI supercycle is the most significant transition in human history and requires the largest economic system upgrade ever attempted.
- Abundant intelligence is constrained only by physical resources and processes. Infinite digital replication redefines our understanding of scarcity.
- Lyle Ventures is interested in physical bottlenecks, scarce digital assets, and tech that is truly life-changing or timeless.

## What We Look For

- **Pure Obsession** — Founders with a deeply personal motivation for their craft
- **Big Swings** — Ideas for changing the rules of the game
- **Endgames** — Clear view of the path to success
- **Competitive Advantage** — Business models that could convincingly achieve sustained barriers to entry
- **Perpetual Motion** — Overwhelming tendency toward non-stop action
- **Kindness** — Founders and teams who are kind at heart
